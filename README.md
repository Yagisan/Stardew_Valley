# Yagisan's Stardew Valley Mods

This is the GitHub respository for Yagisan's Stardew Valley mods. It is mostly a collection of micromods addressing things I felt needed changing in the base game or other mods.

## [Krobus Sells Scrolls](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9248)

This mod was created because finding the dwarf scrolls is purely by chance in the base game.
In game it is established that Krobus and the Dwarf do understand each other, so it is logical to assume Krobus will "acquire" dwarf scrolls.
Upon reaching 4 hearts with Krobus, he will have 1 dwarf scroll, selected randomly, each day.

- This mod requires [Shop Tile Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005) to function.

This mod is part of [The Bustling Valley](https://github.com/Yagisan/The-Bustling-Valley) mod list, but will work independently.

## [Bountiful Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9259)

This mod was created because I wanted a bigger, more dynamic variety of forage in Stardew Valley.

You can find the following additional forage. Some forage items require [PPJA - Mizu's Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2028), and will be skipped if that is not installed.

If today's weather is good, and yesterday's weather was also good, you can find a variety of additional flowers.

If yesterday's weather was rainy, you can find  a variety of mushrooms.

If yesterday's weather was rainy, storm, or windy the beach will have a variety of debris

In both Spring and Fall, the desert briefly comes alive with a short-lived bloom of flowers.

The exact forage found will depend on the weather, the location, and the date.

- This mod requires [Farm Type Manager (FTM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) to function.
- This mod optionally requires [PPJA - Mizu's Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2028) for additional functionality.

## [Bountiful Valley for Boarding House](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9263)

Extends [Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4120) with a variety of new forage.

If today's weather is good, and yesterday's weather was also good, you can find a variety of additional flowers.

If yesterday's weather was rainy, you can find a variety of mushrooms.

All year round, you can find a variety of new forage in The Lost Valley.

The exact forage found will depend on the weather, the location, and the date.

## Better Hilltop

This mod was created because the default Hilltop map quarry is useless in the base game.
This increases the amount of stones, geodes, ore and gems produced by the Hiltop Quarry.

This mod requires [Farm Type Manager (FTM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) to function.

## Better Boarding House

This mod was created because I wanted a bigger variety of wild forage on the Backwoods Plateau map from [Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4120).
You can find the following additional forage. Some forage items require [PPJA - Fruits and Veggies](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1598), and will be skipped if that is not installed.

| Spring | Summer | Fall | Winter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wild Horseradish | Spice Berry | Chanterelle | Holly |

## [Custom NPCs for NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8174)

This mod was created to show custom NPC's on the world map using [NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239). **It does not include any maps.**

### Compatibility

**These mods are optional, and they will be skipped if they are missing.**

Locations and tooltips are dynamically enabled for each support mod. For example, if you don't use Stardew Valley Expanded, you won't get those locations and tooltip on your map.

If a mod supports an NPC with a selectable gender, only the default gender will be supported, if they share the same unique ID.

### Known Issues

NPCs appear in the top left corner of the map. Not actually a bug with this mod's data. That location is where [NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239) draws things it doesn't know where they go by default.
