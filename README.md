# Yagisan's Stardew Valley Mods

This is the GitHub respository for Yagisan's Stardew Valley mods. It is mostly a collection of micromods addressing things I felt needed changing in the base game or other mods.

## Krobus Sells Scrolls

This mod was created because finding the dwarf scrolls is purely by chance in the base game.
In game it is established that Krobus and the Dwarf do understand each other, so it is logical to assume Krobus will "aquire" dwarf scrolls.
Upon reaching 4 hearts with Krobus, he will have 1 dwarf scroll, selected randomly, each day.

This mod requires [Shop Tile Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005) to function.

## Better Hilltop

This mod was created because the default Hilltop map quarry is useless in the base game.
This increases the amount of stones, geodes, ore and gems produced by the Hiltop Quarry.

This mod requires [Farm Type Manager (FTM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) to function.

## Better Boarding House

This mod was created because I wanted a bigger variety of wild forage on the Backwoods Plateau map from [Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4120).
You can find the following additional forage. Some forage items require [PPJA - Fruits and Veggies](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1598), and will be skipped if that is not installed.

| Spring | Summer | Fall | Winter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wild Horseradish | Spice Berry | Chanterelle | Holly |
| Leek | Grape | Wild Plum | Crystal Fruit |
| Dandelion | Sunflower | Red Mushroom | Mint |
| Tulip | Sweet Pea | Sunflower | Juniper Berry |
| Daffodil | Poppy | Hazelnut | Snow Yam |
| Blue Jazz | Summer Spangle | Fairy Rose | Crocus |
  
This mod requires [Farm Type Manager (FTM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3231) to function.
This mod requires [Boarding House and Bus Stop Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4120) to function.
This mod optionally requires [PPJA - Fruits and Veggies](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1598) for additional function.

## [Custom NPCs for NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8174)

### Known Issues

[NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239) hardcodes several locations, such as the [Secret Woods](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods).
I provide alternate locations, however they appear to be ignored as of NPC Map Locations 2.6.2
