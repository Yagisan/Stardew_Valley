[font=Verdana][size=5]Introduction[/size]

Initially this mod was created because crafting low level sprinklers is annoying in the base game. Clint sells lowest quality sprinkler from the start, and once you reach 2 hearts with him, he sells quality sprinklers.
It has now expanded so as your friendship grows with Clint, he starts to sell other metalwork based objects, including Seed Makers, Furnaces, Lightning Rods, and Iron Fencing.
