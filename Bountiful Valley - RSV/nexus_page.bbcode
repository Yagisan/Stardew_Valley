Extends [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7286]Ridgeside Village[/url] with a variety of new forage.

If today's weather is good, and yesterday's weather was also good, you can find a variety of additional flowers.

If yesterday's weather was rainy, you can find a variety of mushrooms.

The exact forage found will depend on the weather, the location, and the date.
